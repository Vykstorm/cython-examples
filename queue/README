This example shows how to use an existing library C by writing an extension using
Cython (it follows this guide: https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/tutorial/clibraries.html)

The goal of this example is to port the implementation of the class Queue defined in the CAlg library (http://c-algorithms.sourceforge.net/)
into Python.

We write the next source files:

- setup.py: This is used to build our Cython extension.
Use python setup.py build_ext --inplace to build the extension in the working directory.

- cqueue.pxd: Contains a subset of routines & classes defined in the header queue.h in the CAlg library
that we want to use in the extension (This represents our public API)

- queue.pyx: Implements the API defined in cqueue.pxd

- test.py: Unitary test for the class Queue
